# axieScholarshipManager
Tool to monitor scholars earning, I also use it to create contest and distribute prizes as shown in http://evtravelvibes.com/scholarshipContest/


## How to use
Modify scholars.json with the adresses of your scholarship accounts and the name of your scholars.

The parameters slpsnapshot is used to take a snapshot if you want to monitor earning from a special point.
If a scholar withdraw his slp you also need to modify this parameter.

I disable the prize function but you can uncomment it to use it.
